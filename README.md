# Fun-with-points

C program that creates an array of random points, sorts it using double selection sort (iterative version) and puts them in a graph
Every point in the array has different coordinates from the others 

- Output example:

![PointsArrayFinal](https://github.com/landiluigi746/Fun-with-points/assets/151780431/a517df4e-2a37-4f5b-a4c2-8cea1a88aa79)

Note: Execution time isn't the sum of sorting and drawing times, but it's the complete program execution time, so it also counts filling and printing times.
